-> Git

- Git is a version control system.
- Git helps you keep track of code changes.

- Git and GitHub are two different things.

- What git can do :- 
	- Manage projects with Repositories
	- Clone a project to work on a local copy
	- Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
	- Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
	- Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
	- Push local updates to the main project
	- Tracking code changes and who made changes.

- Git commands :- 

1) git --version :- To check the version of git.

2) git config --global user.name "name" :- To set global name and email so that others can see who made changes.
   git config --global user.email "email"
   
   git config --global user.name :- To view what username and useremail you have set.
   git config --global user.email

   We can also set user.name amd uer.email using following command
   git config --global --edit :- It will open file which stores your information in VIM(is in linux) editor.

- Repository :- A folder that can be tracked with the help of git.

3) mkdir "folderName"
   cd "folderName"
   git init :- To make this folder as git repository so that git can keep track of this repository.
   ls -a :- Will show all the files including hidden files, We will see a .git folder which actually keeps the track of the changes made.

4) git status :- Gives us the details of the changes made in this repository i.e. changes ,modification ,deletion.
			- This command will give names of all the files that have been changed and not changed 
			  and needs to be added into the staging area in order to commit those(changed) files.

   In git first we track(with the help of below command) a file and then commit a file.

- Staging area :- Where we keep our changes of file/files before committing  file/files.   {   Working_Directory -----(5)-----> Staging_Area -----(6)-----> Repository   }
	Example :- Lets say we have 40 files in a project and we want to commit only 10-15 files in 1 particular commit, then in this case we put these files in staging area.
 
5) git add <fileName1> <fileName2> .... <fileName n> :- To add 'n' of file in staging area.
   git add .  :- dot(.) will add all files in staging area.
   git add -A :- To add all the files in staging area.

6) git commit -m "message" :- To commit files from staging area to repository , -m is used for message. 

	git commit -am "message" :- This command will add the file/files in staging area and commit the files.

7) git log :- Will give us the details of all commits.
   git log --oneline :- Will provide the summarized logs each in one line only. 

- Remember when after committing a file when we do changes in that(committed) file ,then again we have to add that(committed) file in staging area(5) and then only we can commit that file(6)

- How to track changes in git? :- We can track changes in 3 position i.e (i)when file is modified but not added to staged area , (ii)when file is modified and added in stagged area ,
					    (iii)after committing a file.

8) git diff :- Will show difference in lines in comparison of last committed lines for all files.
   git diff fileName:- Will show difference in lines in comparison of last committed lines for a specific file.
	Will show all the lines and newly added lines are in green color whereas deleted one will be shown in red color.
   git diff --staged :- When file is in the staged area.
   git diff HEAD :- Shows difference in all files whether files are untracked or in stagged area.
   git diff oldCommitHash newCommitHash/git diff newCommitHash oldCommitHash :- Show difference between 2 commits(Hash order matters).
   git diff oldCommitHash..newCommitHash/git diff newCommitHash..oldCommitHash :- Show difference between 2 commits(Hash order matters).

9) git rm -f fileName :- To remove file from staging area as well as working directory(means deleting the file completely). -f is used for forcefully deletion.
   git rm --cached fileName :- To remove file from staging area only.

10) git checkout < hashCode/branchName > :- Used to go back to any commit.
    git checkout filename :- It is used to discard the changes of a file which are not stagged yet.
    git checkout . :- Discard all the files changes and all files which are not stagged yet.
    git checkout - :- This command is used to go to the last checked out branch(hyphen[-] is being used).

- Branch :- Branches are used to work on different features/versions , and when all features becomes stable then we combine all branches to main branch i.e. master branch.
		Branches are hierarchal that means one branch can have multiple branches.
		Branches are useful when many people working on a single project/feature.

11) git branch :- Will display all the branches.

12) git branch branchName :- To create a branch , To switch to this newly generated branch use (10,14).

		Example: by default we have master branch, we can create branches as - git branch b1 and git branch b2 , will generate 2 branches under master
			 now we have structure (master -> b1,b2)
			  with {git branch b1} will create branch b1 under master, then {git checkout b1} we are under b1 branch and creating another branch under b1 i.e. b2 using {git branch b2}
			  now we have structure (master -> b1 -> b2).

    git branch -m newBranchName :- To rename the branch, we must be at branch whose name we want to change.
    git branch -d branchName :- To delete a branch with name branchName.-d will delete after merging and if we want to delete without merging we use -D.
    git merge branchName :- Used to merge a branch with its parent/super branch. To merge a branch we must be at its parent branch.

13) git checkout -b branchName :- Will create a branch with branchName and take us to that branch.
    git checkout filename :- It is used to discard the changes of a file while file is not staged.

14) git switch "branchName" :- This command can also be used to switch between multiple branches.
    git switch - :- This command is used to go to the last checked out branch(hyphen[-] is being used).
    git switch -c "branchName" :- This command will create a new branch and switched to the newly created branch.

Git Amend is used when we need to edit the previous commits instead of making a new commit.

15) git commit --amend -m "message" :- This command is used to edit the previous commit.

Restore is used to discard the changes of the files.

16) git restore :- This command is used to restore the changes.
		Suppose we updated a file in master branch, which needs to added in the staged area.
		Now when we create a new branch from master branch that untracked file(updated file) still needs to added into staged area of new branch.
		To discard the changes in new branch we use restore command.
    git restore fileName  :- This command is used to discard the changes of a particular unstaged file.
    git restore --staged :- Discard the changes of all the files from staged area.
    git restore --staged fileName :- Discard the changes of a specific file from staged area which brings the file to unstage area.
    git restore . :- To discard the changes of all the files which exist in unstaged area. This command hides --worktree i.e. git restore --worktree .
    git restore --staged --worktree . :- To discard all the changes(whether files in staged or unstaged) and bring the code to the last commit.

Stash is used to temporary store the changes in branch(instead of commit) while switching to another branch so that changes should not come in another branch 
or to bypass any conflicts if exist.

17) git stash :- It is used to stash the changes before switching to another branch.
    git stash list :- Provides the list of all the stash's of a branch. 
    git stash pop :- It brings back the last stashed changes to the branch.
    git stash apply :- It applies the last stashed changes to the branch, and stash remains on stash list unlike pop.
    git stash drop stash@{no.} :- Deletes the stash from the list.
    git stash clear :- Clear the entire stash list.
    git stash -- fileName :- To stash only one specific file.
    git stash -m "message" -- fileName :- To stash only one specific file with message.
    git stash -m "message" :- To stash only one existing file with message.
    git stash show stash@{no.} :- Provides the details about the stash.
    git stash show -p stash@{no.} :- Shows all the changes of the stash.
    git stash --keep-index :- Stash only untracked file.


 HEAD :- HEAD points to the latest commit of the each branch.
.gitignore :- When we want some of our files should not go into git ecosystem(so that git should not track them) then we add those files in .gitignore file.
		  To create a empty .gitignore file we will use {touch .gitignore} command , and provide name of all the files in .gitignore .
		  Now git will not track all the files in .gitignore but git will be tracking .gitignore file , to overcome this we add .gitignore file name to .gitignore file itself.
		  We can also provide folder name in .gitignore so that it should not be tracked and pushed , to do this we use { folderName/ } . Remember to use '/' after folder name.
		  / represents a directory/folder.
		  * We add those files/folder in .gitignore file which contains sensitive information or large in size.
			


-> GitHub using git commands:- 

1. git remote add origin URL :- To set remote repository where we want to push/pull our code. 

	Origin is just the name of connection although we can have any name but it's recommended to use origin.
	We can verify it using below command.

2. git remote -v :- Will show origin(name of the remote connection) details for push and pull.

3. git branch -M main :- Using this command just to rename the branch , from master to main. NOT MUCH IMPORTANT COMMAND.

4. git push -u origin branchName :- Will push our branch from local repository to origin repository. We can push as many branches as we want.
	
	NOTE:- If using (3) then give main as branchName unless master as branchName. This is only for main/master branch.
		 If want to push any other branch then use (4) again with NAME_OF_THE_BRANCH you want to push on Github.

- After pushing our files to GitHub when we do changes in our file , then we have to add those files into the staged area using (5) and have to perform commit using (6).
   after committing , our changes is still in local repository and if we want to push the changes on Github we have to use { git push }.
   No need to write { -u origin branchName } because our machine knows now where to push.

- Fork :- We can take any open source repository to our personal Github account (If that person(who's repository we are forking) has added you as a contributor in his account)
- Pull :- After doing changes in forked repository when you want add your changes to main repository(that person's repository) then from your account you generate a pull request , 
	    and it's upto the owner of repository whether the owner want to merge your changes into main repository , if owner wants to accept your changes then owner has to accept 
	    the pull request and then merge your repository with the main repository.

5. git clone Github_URL :- To bring a copy of repository from remote to our local machine.
